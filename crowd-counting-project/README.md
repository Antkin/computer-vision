# Crowd Counting project

The goal of this project was to create an algorithm to count the number of people in a surveillance image of a mall. We used a support vector machine to implement this.  In the first part we used an existing person detection technique (facebook detectron2), and in the second part we implemented our own technique using a SVM.
  To run this project simply place the final_project notebook and the frame.zip file in the same directory. From there you can run the cells of the notebook sequentially.
